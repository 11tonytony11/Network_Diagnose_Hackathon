# Network Diagnose Tool (Ort College Covid Hackathon)
This repository is created for my first hackathon at Ort Rehovot College. It is open-source software helping people diagnose network faults. The main goal is to create a smart software that build dynamicllay test-set according to previusly known issues.

Once issue is diagnosed, the user will get detailed and simplified instructions to fix the issue.

Beware the project was never completed since the hackathon ended. However, it does contain most of the core features. The project will be fully implemented in the future.
